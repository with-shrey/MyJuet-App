# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in IRC ([#opengovernment](irc://chat.freenode.net/opengovernment) on freenode). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [My Juet on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.myjuet.com.myjuet&hl=en_IN)
  * [MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) 
  * [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev/android.html) 
  * [JSOUP](https://jsoup.org/) 
  * GitFlow Convention
  
## Contributing
 * Start by commenting on the issue yo want to take a gig at
 * Ask all the questions
 * Fork repository
 * Commit changes using on a new branch Convention: (feature/{username}/feature-name)
 * Create a pull request
 
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Commit only relevant changes

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using 4 spaces (soft tabs)
  * Configure Android Studio to place m before member variables and s before static variables
  * Try to break logic into meanningful functions
  * naming should be robust (Self-Explainatory)
  
Thanks,
Team MyJUET
